&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello! My name is Josh. I moved to Omaha about three years ago after living in St. Louis for about five years. I grew up in McCook, NE which is a small town on the other side of the state. I've worked in kitchens most of my life and moved to St. Louis to attend culinary school right after high school. I was part of a restaurant in St. Louis called <a class="link" href="http://junipereats.com/">Entre</a>. They have renamed it but the idea and menu design is still the same.
			
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love understanding how and why things work. I think that's one of the main things that attracts me to coding. I am currently attending the <a href="http://www.omahacodeschool.com">Omaha Code School</a> and I enjoy exploring new languages. Ruby is my favorite language to work in but I also enjoy coding in PHP. I plan to spend more time on using JavaScript, C#, and Python whenever I have the extra time to do so.
			
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am married with two children (ages 5 and 1). I enjoy watching all kinds of movies and listen to a wide variety of music. I listen to __a lot__ of music. MAHA is one of my favorite music festivals i've been to since moving to Omaha. When the weather lets me, I like to garden, go backpacking, fishing, hunting, forage for mushrooms, and explore places I've never been to before. On the weekends you can find me searching for ingredients at the farmers market or at the park with my kids.
